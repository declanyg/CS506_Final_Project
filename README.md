CS506_Final_Project

Description of the project
- This project is to explore stock prices in the tech field by exploring the iteration between stock movement data, options data, and current events. 
- The goal is to beat a simple buy-sell strategy by modeling the peaks of the stock price over a period of time. The model will be considered a success if the average predicted price difference is within a margin of error. 
- The following data will be collected:
  - Stock movement data
  - Options data
  - Current events (headlines) 
- The model will be modelled with either multi-linear regression, polynomial regression, or a neural network
- It will be visualized by charting price against time and comparing our predicted price vs the actual price over a time period
- The data will follow a standard train test val split, 80-10-10, within the past year (Sep 2023 to Sep 2024).

# Introduction

In this write up, we will detail our experiments in explorations of stock prices; more specifically, on writing a model that, given an aggregate of news headlines from various sources and the calculated sentiments associated with each, will output a series of predictions on the prices. We will step through the engineering decisions from ticker price choices and feature extraction to model selection, and explain how each of these components ultimately helped our goal of predicting future stock prices.
